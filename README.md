In this folder, you will find the different programs for post-processing the meteorological data from the ERA5 reanalyses. The objective is to verify to what extent the atmospheric model of the reanalyses takes into account the presence of Antarctic coastal polynyas.

The programs are characterised in two ways: those with a set of tool functions (ToolsPolynyas.py and MapDrawing.py) and those with which these functions are applied to the data sets.

 - ToolsPolynyas.py contains all the functions for working directly on the data sets, adapting and calculating the parameters of the reanalyses.

 - MapDrawing.py allows you to draw all the maps necessary for the study.
